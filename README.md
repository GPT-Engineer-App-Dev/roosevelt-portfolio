# roosevelt-portfolio

Create a professional and engaging home page for the personal website of Franklin Roosevelt. The page should include:

- A header with Franklin Roosevelt's name
- A navigation menu with a link to the home page (additional links will be added later)
- A main content section with:
  - A high-quality, professional photo of Franklin Roosevelt 
  - A concise biography (2-3 paragraphs) summarizing his early life, political career, and presidency, highlighting major accomplishments like the New Deal and leading the US through WWII
- A simple, classic design with a color scheme reminiscent of the 1930s-40s era
- A footer with a simple copyright notice

For the biography text, do research to include accurate and relevant information, but keep it brief for this initial version. We'll expand on it later as needed.
